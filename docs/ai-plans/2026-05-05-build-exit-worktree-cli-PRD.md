## Problem

The blueprint worktree lifecycle has two gaps after the prior worktree-per-feature implementation (completed April 2026):

1. `/build` enters a worktree via `EnterWorktree` but never exits. After all sections complete, the session context remains "inside" the feature branch. A developer who runs `/build` in their main repo window is stuck in the worktree context until they manually restart — there is no clean handoff back to the main repo.

2. Worktree cleanup requires Claude. There is no terminal-based CLI script in the plugin for developers who want to remove a worktree without opening a Claude session. The `/cleanup-worktree` skill covers the Claude-assisted path; nothing covers the manual path.

As a minor gap: `hooks/hooks.json` declares both `WorktreeCreate` and `WorktreeRemove`, but only `WorktreeRemove` has a corresponding assertion test in the test suite. `WorktreeCreate` has no hooks.json smoke test, making it easy to accidentally break the hook wiring without a test catching it.

## Solution

Three targeted additions that close the remaining lifecycle gaps:

1. Add `ExitWorktree` to `/build` after Step 6b (after the final PRD commit). The skill announces completion, exits the worktree, and prints the handoff message so the user is back in the main repo context before the session ends.

2. Add `scripts/worktree-remove-cli` to the plugin — a one-shot bash script that takes a branch name, computes the sibling worktree path, removes the worktree via `scripts/worktree-remove`, and prompts the developer to optionally delete the branch.

3. Add a `WorktreeCreate` hooks.json assertion to `tests/worktree-create.sh`, mirroring the equivalent test already in `tests/worktree-remove.sh`.

## User stories

1. As a developer, when `/build` completes all sections, I want my Claude session to return to the main repo context so I can do PR work without manually switching worktrees.
2. As a developer, I want to remove a worktree from the terminal using a script in the plugin, without needing a Claude session.

## Architecture & module sketch

- **`skills/build/SKILL.md`** — Add `ExitWorktree` call after Step 6b. Call it after the final PRD commit, before printing the handoff message. If no worktree was entered (no `Worktree:` field in the PLAN), skip `ExitWorktree`.
- **`scripts/worktree-remove-cli`** — New bash script. Takes `<branch-name>` as its only argument. Derives `WORKTREE_DIR` using the same sibling formula as `scripts/worktree-create`: `$(dirname "$REPO_ROOT")/$(basename "$REPO_ROOT")-worktrees/$BRANCH`. Calls `scripts/worktree-remove "$WORKTREE_DIR"` (relative to the script's own directory), captures the returned branch name, and prompts the user to optionally delete the branch.
- **`tests/build-worktree-entry.sh`** — Add grep assertions verifying `ExitWorktree` appears in the build skill's completion steps.
- **`tests/worktree-create.sh`** — Add hooks.json assertions for `WorktreeCreate`, mirroring tests/worktree-remove.sh lines 125–143.

## Testing approach

- `tests/build-worktree-entry.sh`: grep `skills/build/SKILL.md` for `ExitWorktree`. Assert it appears, and assert it is conditional on a `Worktree:` field being present (backwards-compat check).
- `tests/worktree-create.sh`: assert `hooks/worktree-create.sh` is executable; assert `hooks/hooks.json` references `WorktreeCreate` and `worktree-create.sh`.
- `tests/worktree-remove-cli.sh` (new): create a temp repo + sibling worktree; run the script with the branch name; assert worktree directory is gone; assert `git worktree list` no longer shows it. Branch-deletion prompt is interactive — skip it in the test by passing `n` via stdin.

## Out of scope

- Auto cleanup on session end (rejected during brainstorm — too risky for unmerged work)
- Changes to `scripts/worktree-create` (sibling path already implemented)
- Changes to `scripts/worktree-remove` (already correct)
- Updating `~/.claude/scripts/worktree-create` or `~/.claude/scripts/worktree-remove-cli` (global user scripts, not plugin-owned)
- Any changes to `/cleanup-worktree` skill (already complete and correct)

## Open questions

- [ ] Does `ExitWorktree` need to be called conditionally only if `EnterWorktree` was called earlier, or is it safe to call unconditionally (no-op if not in a worktree)?
